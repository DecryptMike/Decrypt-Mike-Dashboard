</h2>

<h4 align="center">
    The Decrypt Mike Dashboard Is A Modern, Interactive Platform Showcasing Cyber Security Tools. Featuring A Cyber Punk Design And Matrix Inspired Visuals, It Provides Users With A Set Of Practical, Hands-On-Tools Like Port Scanners And Password Crackers. It Serves As A Functional FictionalToolbox For Cyber Security Enthusiasts And Professionals.<br><br>
In This Project, I Leveraged Modern Web Development Tools (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, And Vercel) To Build A Dynamic And Visually Engaging Dashboard With A Strong Cybersecurity Theme. Professional Tactics Like User-Centered Design, Responsive Layout, Modular Code Structure, And Performance Optimization Were Employed To Ensure That The Dashboard Is Not Only Visually Appealing But Also Efficient And Scalable For Future Updates.
